        Ranks teams based on a special ranking system where each voter provides a rank
        from highest to lowest for all teams.
        
        Teams are ranked by:
        1. Number of position-one votes (highest to lowest)
        2. If tied, by position-two votes, and so on
        3. If still tied after considering all positions, alphabetically by team letter
